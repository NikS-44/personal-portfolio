  Critique the app's UX/UI using Chrome DevTools MCP: persona-based task flows, Nielsen heuristic sweeps, WCAG
  accessibility spot-checks, and error injection. Produces structured findings with severity + screenshot evidence.
---

# UX Critique

**Purpose:** Identify usability, accessibility, and interaction friction using Chrome DevTools MCP and screenshots
evaluated against established heuristics. Complements `chrome-devtools-verify` (shipping correctness) — this skill
checks **UX quality**.

**Requires:** Chrome DevTools MCP connected. Run `list_pages` to confirm before starting.

## Modes

| Mode                | Best for                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Heuristic sweep** | Quick audit of a single page or component     |
| **Persona flow**    | Walk a multi-step user task end-to-end        |
| **Error injection** | Verify error states are clear and recoverable |
| **Full audit**      | All three modes combined                      |

Pick a mode from the user's request, or default to **full audit** on the primary changed route.

---

## Setup

1. `pnpm dev:ready` — note Vite URL (usually `:5173`).
2. `list_pages` — confirm MCP is connected.
3. Define **scope**: which route(s) or flow(s) to evaluate.
4. Define **persona** if running a flow (template below).

---

## Mode 1: Heuristic Sweep

1. `navigate_page` → `take_snapshot` → `take_screenshot` to `verification/<branch>/ux-<route>-01-load.png`
   (`fullPage: true`).
2. Screenshot each distinct state (empty, loaded, error) separately.
3. For interactive elements: **before** screenshot → interact → `take_snapshot` → **after** screenshot. Use paired
   names: `ux-<route>-02-before-<action>.png` / `ux-<route>-03-after-<action>.png`.
4. Evaluate each heuristic below, note evidence and severity.

### Nielsen's 10 Heuristics

| #   | Heuristic                           | What to check                                                            |
| --- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| H1  | Visibility of system status         | Loading spinners, progress bars, async feedback, skeleton screens        |
| H2  | Match between system and real world | Terminology, icon clarity, mental model alignment, no jargon             |
| H3  | User control and freedom            | Undo, cancel, back nav, escape hatches from flows                        |
| H4  | Consistency and standards           | Labels, layout, and interaction patterns match the rest of the app       |
| H5  | Error prevention                    | Confirmation dialogs, input constraints, guards on destructive actions   |
| H6  | Recognition over recall             | Labels visible at the point of need; no cross-screen memory required     |
| H7  | Flexibility and efficiency          | Keyboard nav, shortcuts, power-user paths, no forced click-through       |
| H8  | Aesthetic and minimalist design     | Visual noise, info hierarchy, irrelevant content                         |
| H9  | Help users recover from errors      | Error message clarity (plain language), next-step guidance, no dead ends |
| H10 | Help and documentation              | Tooltips, inline help, empty-state guidance, onboarding cues             |

## Mode 2: Persona Flow

Define the persona (ask the user if unclear; otherwise infer from context):

```
Persona: <role + technical level, e.g. "first-time user, non-technical, on a laptop">
Goal: <what they are trying to accomplish in one sentence>
Starting state: <URL, auth state, seed data if needed>
Task sequence:
  1. <natural-language step, e.g. "Find the export button and download the CSV">
  2. ...
Success criteria: <what "done" looks like>
```

For **each task step**: `take_snapshot` → **before** screenshot → `click` / `fill` / `type_text` → **after** screenshot.
Log friction (confusing labels, missing affordances, unexpected state) and tag the relevant heuristic.

After the flow: `list_console_messages` (errors/warnings) and `list_network_requests` (failed or slow >2 s). Score: did
the persona complete the goal? How many steps? Any dead ends?

## Mode 3: Error Injection

| Scenario            | How to trigger                                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Empty required form | Leave all required fields blank, submit                   |
| Invalid input       | Malformed email, string over limit, negative number       |
| Unauthorized        | Access a protected resource without credentials           |
| Not found           | Navigate to a non-existent route (e.g. `/does-not-exist`) |

For each: **before** screenshot → trigger → `take_snapshot` → **after** screenshot. Evaluate against **H9** (recovery)
and **H5** (prevention): plain-language message, clear next step, no lost work.

## Accessibility Spot-Check

Run automatically as part of any audit:

```
lighthouse_audit(url: <current page URL>, categories: ["accessibility"])
```

- Lighthouse a11y score ≥ 90 → pass; < 90 → flag findings.
- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (normal text), ≥ 3:1 (large text/UI components).
- Interactive elements have visible focus rings; form inputs have visible labels.
- Images have `alt` text; ARIA roles used correctly; tab order is logical.

## Severity Levels

| Level        | Definition                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Blocks task completion for any user; treat as a blocking bug  |
| **Major**    | Significant friction; most users will notice; fix before ship |
| **Minor**    | Suboptimal; noticeable but a workaround exists                |
| **Info**     | Polish or future improvement; does not block ship             |
