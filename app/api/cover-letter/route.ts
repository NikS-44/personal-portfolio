      1. My resume: ${resume}
      2. Job description: ${jobDescription}
      3. Key points to emphasize: ${jobSpecificEmphasis}

      Guidelines:
        - Tone: friendly, enthusiastic, and professional.
        - Do not mention anything as advertised, leave any placeholders, or mention how my experience directly aligns with the job description.
        - Highlight how my values align with the companyâ€™s mission, but do not explicitly restate their mission from the job posting.
        - Structure: around 4 short paragraphs
        - First paragraph: a quick intro of the role I'm interested in, my background, and how it aligns with the role.
        - Second paragraph: an example or anecdote illustrating my skills related to ${jobSpecificEmphasis}. Make sure it is related to the job description.
        - Third paragraph: express excitement about this opportunity and how I can contribute.
        - Fourth paragraph: closing statement that says you are looking forward hearing from them and discussing how you could help their company.
        - Do not copy or closely paraphrase the job description or my resume. Instead, highlight only the most relevant parts.
        - Avoid long, wordy sentences. Keep paragraphs concise and focused.
        - Show, don't just tell. Demonstrate my strengths with a brief example rather than listing them plainly.
        - Make it sound genuine and human, without being too formulaic.
